Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a curious boy named vineet
Vineet exploring the woods, chasing butterflies, and watching the stars.  
One day, he found a shiny key buried under an old tree.  
He wondered what the key could open.  
Every day after that, he searched the village for a lock that matched the key.  
Finally, one rainy evening, he discovered a hidden door behind the waterfall.  
With a racing heart, he turned the key and stepped inside to begin a new adventure.
