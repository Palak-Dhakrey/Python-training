Consistent Input Validation: Most programs validate user input or data format.

Use of Loops: Repetition is used where needed (e.g., ATM, chatbot, attendance, password).

Conditionals: If-else logic drives all program decisions.

Class Usage: Employee Attendance Tracker uses OOP concepts (classes, methods).

Simplicity First: All logic is kept easy to understand and customize.

No External Dependencies: Only the standard library is used (re, uuid, time).
